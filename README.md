The platform to announce courses in Rio Claro is developed by the city hall, through the Economic Development Department, in partnership with Claretianos Universitary Center.

## Technical Info

The project is divided into backend and frontend approaches, building a simple API to be consumed in the frontend. The technologies applied in this project are listed below:

### TypeScript
Initially, JavaScript was used for development, which worked fine but presented challenges due to its dynamic typing. TypeScript was introduced to address typing issues, making the code easier to maintain and debug.

### MySQL
MySQL is the chosen DBMS for this project due to familiarity and widespread use among developers and students. It's easy to maintain the database using MySQL, and the Workbench tool is handy for those who aren't accustomed to writing SQL commands.

### EJS
JavaScript teamplate, simle to use, focused on server side proccess.

### Express
Express is simple to use and easy to learn. Students who need to develop and implement new features will quickly become familiar with Express, especially if they are already comfortable with asynchronous programming.

### Node.js
Node.js is the JavaScript runtime environment used in this project. It provides the HTTPS server, as Express itself only supports HTTP.

### Dependencies
Please refer to `package.json` for a list of all dependencies used in this project.
