# Thecnichal info
The project is devided in backend and frontend aproachs, building an simple API to be consumed in the
frontend. The thecnologies aplied in this project are listed bellow:

*TypeScript
  The first option for development was using JavaScript, wich worked fine during development but since
  JS uses dinamic typing, some parts of the code ware quite dificult to debug. For best pratices, TS came
  resolve the typing issue and make the code easy to maintain.

*MySQL
  DBMS used in this project by familiarity, most developers and students at some point learn how to use it,
  plus is really easy to maintain the data base using mySQL, the workbeanch tool is handful for those who aren't
  used to write SQL commands.

*React
  Considering the learning curve, react is always a great option to compound the pages features. Use components
  make it easy to edit features in the frontend and also make the code more readable without endless html.

*Express
  Express is simple to use and easy to learn, any other studenty who gets the mission to develop new features
  and implement then, will learn express really fast (once the studenty is familiar with async programming).

*Node.js
  No secreats here, JS runtime enviroment. Also, the https server is provided using node, since the express only 
  provides http.

*Dependencies 
  Take a look on package.json, all dependencies are listed there.
